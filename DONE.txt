stuff that was previously in TODO but it is now done, so they are moved here,
for historical reasons and to perhaps prevent someone from attempting to do the same thing, if it was already done
this is also to keep out the clutter within the TODO file


//done - try compiling with jdk6 and see what needs to be reduced from being only jdk7 compatible (tho so far compiling with only jdk7 works fine on tests)

//done - look into how Factions is preventing commands to be executed while in enemy territory, to perhaps use that strategy to trap
  only certain commands like /home  rather than what we currently use: PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent
  //checked: it's using the same Event but with a LOW priority so they are trapped before the MONITOR event

//done - /f gc  is non-functional and /f fc

//done- fix lwc to remove also wooden/iron/trapdoor when claiming land
